# Corrects ownership - host bind mounts, and the image-baked CLI prefix -
# then drops to PUID:PGID.
#
# Compose binds CODEMAN_APPDATA_PATH and CODEMAN_CASES_PATH from the host. When
# either path does not exist yet - a first run, a cleared application-data
# directory, a restored backup - the Docker daemon creates it owned by root,
# and an unprivileged server cannot then create its own state directory. The
# result is a container that restarts forever on:
#
#   Failed to start web server: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/home/<user>/.codeman'
#
# Running this as root and dropping afterwards removes that failure mode without
# leaving the server privileged. The same root start also lets it re-assert
# /opt/codeman-cli's ownership on every start, not just at image build time -
# see the comment at that chown below for why that matters for anyone who
# runs the compose file directly rather than through Start-Codeman.sh.
#
# Capabilities this script needs against the compose file's `cap_drop: ALL`
# (test/docker-entrypoint.test.ts pins the list against docker-compose.yaml):
#   CHOWN + DAC_OVERRIDE  the chown of a root-owned bind source below
#   SETUID + SETGID       the setpriv drop itself
#   KILL                  NOT used here, but required by the container: with
#                         `init: true` tini is PID 1 and runs as root while the
#                         server runs as PUID, and signalling a process of a
#                         different uid needs CAP_KILL. Without it every
#                         `docker compose down`/`restart` ends in tini dying with
#                         "Unexpected error when forwarding signal" and the
#                         server being SIGKILLed instead of stopping cleanly.
