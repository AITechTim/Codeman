/**
 * @fileoverview Verify that a programmatically sent prompt actually LEFT the composer,
 * and press Enter again while it has not.
 *
 * Claude Code 2.1.277 (auto-installed 2026-09-18) takes typed text the moment its
 * composer paints but ignores Enter for the first 30 to 50 seconds after it, so the
 * `send-keys -l <text>` + `send-keys Enter` pair `TmuxManager.sendInput()` sends 50 ms
 * apart leaves the prompt sitting on the composer with `0 tokens`, and every caller
 * that then waits for the turn (send-and-wait, the agent skill, the maintainer bot,
 * cron, Ralph) burns its whole timeout on a turn that never started. Measured through
 * the input route on 2026-09-19: an Enter at 28 s stranded, one at 51 s submitted.
 *
 * The rule: after a write that carried a carriage return, read the pane on a short
 * schedule; while the LAST composer line (the CLI's own prompt glyph) still holds the
 * head of what was sent, send Enter again. An empty composer ends it, and so does a
 * composer holding anything else, because that text is the user's or the CLI's, never
 * ours. A pane with no composer line at all (a shell, a CLI whose glyph is not
 * declared, a direct-PTY session with no pane to read) does nothing: this runs for
 * EVERY programmatic sender, so a blind Enter here could confirm a dialog nobody asked
 * about. The composer is the last glyph line on purpose: Claude Code echoes a submitted
 * prompt with the same glyph higher up in the transcript, so only the last one says
 * whether the text was taken.
 *
 * Pure apart from the injected capture, send and log, so the schedule, the cap and
 * every stop condition are unit-tested with fake timers (test/session-submit-verifier.test.ts).

/**
 * When to look, counted from the write: 2 s catches the common case (taken) with one
 * capture, and the tail reaches 60 s, past twice the longest window measured. Enter is
 * re-sent at every check that still finds the prompt, so a 50 s window costs about
 * seven Enters and one capture each; a taken prompt costs one capture.
