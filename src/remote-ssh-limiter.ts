/**
 * @fileoverview Global concurrency limiter for the short-lived `ssh` children that
 * remote-case file access spawns (`src/remote-files.ts`: the realpath+stat probe and
 * the buffered text read).
 *
 * Two paths can fan those out without a human behind each one:
 *
 * - `GET /api/sessions/:id/attachments` resolves every history entry (up to
 *   `ATTACHMENT_HISTORY_LIMIT`, 100), and the attachments drawer re-runs it on every
 *   `attachment:detected` event while it is open, which is exactly when an agent is
 *   writing files. The route now batches the probes, but a burst of drawers is still
 *   a burst.
 * - A `codeman://attach?path=` magic link in terminal output registers the path
 *   fire-and-forget, once per distinct link per PTY chunk. In a remote session that
 *   output is written by a process on the remote host, so a prompt-injected agent can
 *   print hundreds of links and have the server fork one `ssh` per link, each holding
 *   a 20s probe timeout.
 *
 * Without a cap that is the fork-bomb shape `document-conversion-limiter.ts` exists to
 * prevent, and it also trips OpenSSH's default `MaxStartups 10:30:100`, which starts
 * dropping connections at ten unauthenticated handshakes. This is that limiter for
 * ssh: a small fixed pool, FIFO queueing, and a slot handed straight to the next
 * waiter on release so the active count can never exceed the cap under interleaved
 * async resumption.
 *
 * Streams (`remoteCreateReadStream`) are deliberately NOT counted: one is opened per
 * browser request and held for the life of a media playback, so four open videos
 * would otherwise block every preview and the history list. They are already gated
 * behind a counted probe (the guard re-probe runs first), so their spawn RATE is
 * bounded here even though their concurrency is bounded by the browser.
 *
 * NOT re-entrant: never acquire from inside a task already holding a slot.
 */

/**
 * Max remote probes/reads allowed to run concurrently across the whole process.
