/**
 * @fileoverview Custom Model Endpoint Profiles CRUD + discovery
 * (docs/custom-model-endpoints-plan.md). Endpoints are machine-level infra,
 * like remote/docker hosts, so writes are admin-only in multi-user mode
 * (`case-routes.ts`'s `/api/remote-hosts` is the pattern this mirrors).
 *
 * Discovery (`POST /:id/discover-models`) fetches `${baseUrl}/v1/models`
 * through `webviewFetch()` (`webview-egress.ts`), the same guarded dispatcher
 * the web-tab proxy uses: `baseUrl` is refused at save time by the schema's
 * hostname check (link-local / cloud-metadata literals and names), and the
 * undici lookup hook refuses a name that RESOLVES into one of those ranges at
 * connect time, redirects included — a save-time hostname check alone would
 * let `models.example` resolve to 169.254.169.254 later. The endpoint is
 * admin-configured, so this is defence in depth rather than the only gate.

 * actually confirms readiness — this call's response is never read, just its side
 * effect. No abort/timeout of its own either: a real load can take well over a minute for
 * a large model, and this is a normal long-running Node process, so there is nothing to
 * clean up by cutting it short. Errors are swallowed for the same reason `discoverModels`'s
 * siblings swallow theirs — one endpoint's hiccup here is a nice-to-have that failed, not
 * something worth surfacing as a request failure four layers up.
