/**
 * @fileoverview The env-var half of the multi-user privilege clamp.
 *
 * A session's `envOverrides` can hand back privilege that the per-CLI config
 * clamp removed, so a non-granted owner's overrides get the privileged keys
 * stripped before the session is built. The create and resume routes are what
 * this bites on: they clamp what a request asked for.
 *
 * The reboot-restore route calls it as defence in depth, and today it can strip
 * nothing. `Session.getEnvOverridesForPersist()` keeps only `CLAUDE_CODE_*` and
 * `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` out of a session's overrides, claude's `privilegedEnvKeys`
 * are the five `ANTHROPIC_*` names, and that pass admits claude alone — so a
 * persisted record cannot carry a clamped key. The call is there for the day the
 * persisted set widens. The grant re-resolution that does bite on that path is
 * `resolveClaudeModeForUsername`, which recomputes the permission mode.
 *
 * This lives outside `web/routes` on purpose. The question it answers is about
 * session privilege rather than about HTTP, and `cron/cron-service.ts` sets the
 * precedent by importing `canUsernameRunPrivilegedCommands` from `user-store.ts`
 * directly and re-resolving the owner's grant when a job fires. Every caller here
 * re-resolves the grant at the moment it builds a session, for the same reason.

/**
 * Env-var keys a non-granted owner must not be able to set, because each one
 * hands back privilege `clampExternalCliBypassForOwner()` just removed, or redirects a
 * credential-resolution endpoint.
 *
 * The DeepSeek three are reachable because `DSH_*` and `DEEPSEEK_*` are
 * allowlisted `envOverrides` prefixes (schemas.ts) — which they have to be, since
 * that is also how a user configures the harness's non-privileged knobs.
 *
 * - `DSH_PERMISSION_MODE` IS the harness's permission switch. Every other CLI's
 *   bypass is a command-line FLAG, reachable only through the per-CLI config the
 *   clamp already owns; this one is an env var, so the config clamp alone is
 *   half a gate.
 * - `DSH_HOME` points the launcher at a profile tree, and a profile's plugin code
 *   executes at BOOT, before any approval row can apply. A user who can write a
 *   workspace can put a profile in it, so this is the wider of the two.
 * - `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` aims the provider endpoint, and `_configureCliEnv()`
 *   forwards the SERVER's own `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` into every dsh pane before
 *   `applyEnvOverrides()` runs — so a non-granted owner who could set the base
 *   URL would have the operator's API key sent as a bearer credential to a host
 *   of their choosing. (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` itself stays overridable: supplying
 *   your OWN key removes privilege rather than granting it.)
 * - `OMP_AUTH_BROKER_URL`/`OMP_AUTH_BROKER_TOKEN` are where omp resolves
 *   credentials from — the same shape as `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` above, reachable
 *   because `OMP_*` is an allowlisted prefix. Unlike DeepSeek, Codeman does not
 *   forward any operator-held key into an omp pane today (omp's provider
 *   credentials live in `~/.omp` config files, not env vars), so there is no
 *   known concrete exfiltration path yet — clamped defensively anyway, since a
 *   non-granted owner redirecting where a shared multi-tenant deployment
 *   resolves auth from is not something to allow silently (found in
 *   Ark0N/Codeman#353 review; omp's own knobs are otherwise mostly `PI_*`,
 *   already allowlisted for pi and not addressed here — see resolveOmpHome()).

/**
 * Env-var half of the multi-user bypass clamp.
 *
 * `clampExternalCliBypassForOwner()` in `web/routes/session-routes.ts` clamps the
 * per-CLI CONFIG, and for every CLI
 * but DeepSeek that is the whole story. Here it is not: `applyEnvOverrides()` runs
 * AFTER `_configureCliEnv()` in tmux-manager, so an override sent on the SAME
 * request lands last and wins, and a non-granted owner could restore
 * `danger-full-access` on the very request the config clamp downgraded.
 *
 * Keys are DROPPED rather than rewritten: dropping falls through to what
 * `_configureCliEnv()` exports, which is the clamped config and the server's own
 * `DSH_HOME`, i.e. exactly the intended state. No-op in single-user mode and for a
 * granted owner, like every other clamp here
 * (`canUsernameRunPrivilegedCommands()` returns true when `!isMultiUserMode()`),
 * and it returns the caller's own object untouched when there is nothing to strip.
